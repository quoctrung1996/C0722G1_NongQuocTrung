        Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write
        easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs
        all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural
        science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also
        the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things
        in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write
        well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers
        were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good
        at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.</p>
