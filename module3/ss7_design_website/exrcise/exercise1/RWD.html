      Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write
      easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs
      all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural
      science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also
      the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things
      in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write
      well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers
      were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good
      at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.</p>
